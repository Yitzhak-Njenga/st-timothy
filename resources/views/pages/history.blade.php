                        <p class="ms-auto mb-0"><strong>In the year 2007, St. Stephen’s Church Waithaka experienced a kind of
                            exodus when a group of members started to settle down in their homes
                            built far away from Dagoretti, some in Ruai and others in Ruiru. Church
                            members were encouraged to look for land and settle down in Waithaka
                            in a gated community because it was easy to purchase land as a group.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This provoked twenty-seven members to come together, contribute
                            funds and settle down as advised. They purchased land in Kagira with
                            the help of the late Mwalimu Kiriba under the leadership of Mr. Justin
                            Mwai, Mr. Daniel Maina – Chairman, Mrs. Agnes Karanu – Secretary,
                            Mr. Josiah Mwai – Treasurer and other members. It was during the
                            balloting for plot allocation for those members that the idea of putting
                            up a church was conceived, in the year 2010.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Parish Church Council (PCC) adopted the idea of planting a church
                            in the area and charged Ms. Anne Wanjiku, Mr. Erastus Mukuria, Mrs.
                            Catherine Mugo, Captain Kelvin Nyoike and Mr. Evanson Githinji with
                            the responsibility of looking for a plot at Kagira/ Ruthimitu.
